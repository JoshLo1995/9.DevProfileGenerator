                        My name is Joshua Lo, and I am a motorsport fanatic. My life's pursuit is toward working in professional motorsport, with the dream of working as part of a Formula 1 team. I went to Washington State University to study mechanical engineering to chase this dream and almost succeeded. I ended up joining a club during my time there called 'Wazzu Racing' that competed in an international design and engineering competition held by the Society of Automotive Engineers, called Formula SAE. Out of nowhere, the big dumb attacked me and I ended up dropping out.

                        On the other hand, I am also an ex-powerlifter as seen in the picture to the left - where I was competing against the strongest people in the state of Washington. Originally, I was obese and due for a heart attack at 21. Instead of falling over and dying like a chump, I channeled my energy into becoming fit and became obsessed with fitness to the point where I was going to the gym everyday. Eventually, I accidentally reached the point where I was strong enough to compete for state records - and so I did. I would go on to win my first and only competition winning a record in combined push and pull.

                        Now where these two stories tie together is that one day during the testing of one of the race cars built by my team, I realized that I could barely fit in the car and could not turn the steering wheel without undoing my saftey belts. Something had to change. My new goal was to shed my excess muscle so I would become a more fit race car driver. Instead, I just stopped working out and got fat again and here we are today.
